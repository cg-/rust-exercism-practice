# Rust Track Exercises from Exercism.org

This repository contains my solutions to the Rust track exercises from Exercism.org. Each exercise typically focuses on a particular concept or problem-solving technique in Rust.

## How to Use This Repository

- Each exercise is organized into its own directory named after the exercise.
- Inside each exercise directory, you'll find:
  - `README.md` (if provided by Exercism) describing the problem statement and constraints.
  - `src/` directory containing the Rust source code file(s) with my solution.
  - `tests/` directory containing test cases (if provided by Exercism).

## Getting Started

To get started with these Rust exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the exercise directory you're interested in.
3. Open the `README.md` file to read the exercise details.
4. Open the Rust source files in the `src/` directory to see my solutions.
